Problem-Statement:-

Given an array having both positive and negative integers. 
The task is to compute the length of the largest subarray with sum 0.

Constraints:-

1 <= N <= 10^5
-1000 <= A[i] <= 1000, for each valid i

Sample-1:

Input:- N = 8, A = {15, -2, 2,-8, 1,7,10,23}
Ouptut:- 5

Sample-2:

Input:- N = 6, A = {3,-4,5,0,4,5}
Ouptut:- 1
