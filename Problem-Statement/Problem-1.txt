Problem-Statement:- 

You are given an integer array vec that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Determine if it is possible to split vec into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:
Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e.each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
All subsequences have a length of 3 or more.
Return true if you can split vec according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.

Constraints:-

1 <= v.length <= 104
-1000 <= v[i] <= 1000


Sample-1:-

Input:- v = {1,2,3,3,4,5}
Ouput:- true

Sample-2 :-

Input:- v = {1,2,3,4,4,5}
Ouput:- false
